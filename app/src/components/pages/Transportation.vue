        <b>Transportation</b>

        <div>
            There are many modes of transportation, but some people want the really high end vehicles, which can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
            You can take better options via walking, riding a bike, taking a bus, etc. rather than having a really expensive car.  Even rideshare apps (e.g. Uber, Lyft)
            can start to get expensive.
