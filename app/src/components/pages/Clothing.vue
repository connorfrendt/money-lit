            We all need to wear clothes to obey laws and social norms. You can
            get affordable clothing by shopping at a thrift store (such as Goodwill or Value
            Village) or buying items on sale that fit your budget. But expensive clothing and
            shoes, like Louboutin’s or Air Jordan’s, are wants.
